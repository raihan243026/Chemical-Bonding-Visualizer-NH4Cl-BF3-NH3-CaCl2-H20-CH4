NH4Cl (Ammonium Chloride)
NH4Cl has a combination of ionic, covalent, and coordinate covalent (dative) bonds.

Covalent Bonds within NH4+: The nitrogen atom forms three covalent bonds with hydrogen atoms.

Coordinate Covalent Bond within NH4+: A lone pair on the nitrogen atom in NH3 is donated to an H+ ion to form the fourth N-H bond.

Ionic Bond: The positively charged ammonium ion (NH4+) forms an ionic bond with the negatively charged chloride ion (Cl-).

2. BF3 (Boron Trifluoride)
BF3 has covalent bonds. Boron, a Group 13 element, shares its three valence electrons with three fluorine atoms. Each fluorine atom contributes one electron to form a shared pair, resulting in three single covalent bonds. Boron does not achieve an octet in this compound, making it an electron-deficient molecule.

3. NH3 (Ammonia)
NH3 has covalent bonds. The nitrogen atom forms three single covalent bonds with three hydrogen atoms. Nitrogen has one lone pair of electrons.

4. CaCl2 (Calcium Chloride)
CaCl2 has ionic bonds. Calcium (a metal) readily loses two electrons to become a Ca2+ ion. Each chlorine (a non-metal) gains one electron to become a Cl- ion. The oppositely charged ions are attracted to each other, forming strong electrostatic forces (ionic bonds).

5. H2O (Water)
H2O has covalent bonds. Oxygen forms two single covalent bonds with two hydrogen atoms. Oxygen also has two lone pairs of electrons.

6. CH4 (Methane)
CH4 has covalent bonds. The carbon atom forms four single covalent bonds with four hydrogen atoms, sharing one electron with each.
